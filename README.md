   ```
   - Enter your Supabase project URL and anon key when prompted
   - Save the generated passwords securely

### 4. Deploy Services
1. Deploy location ingestion service from root directory:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret bulk location-inserter/secrets.json --name location-inserter
   npm run deploy --prefix location-inserter
   ```
   Note the deployed URL (e.g., `https://location-inserter.your-name.workers.dev`)

2. Deploy web interface from root directory:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret bulk app/secrets.json --name tracker
   npm run deploy --prefix app
   ```

### 5. Configure OwnTracks

2. Go to Settings (click ‚ìò icon)
3. Configure the following settings:
   - **TrackerID**: Your initials (e.g., "KS")
   - **DeviceID**: Descriptive device name (e.g., "Klim's iPhone")
   - **UserID**: Use "AUTH_USER" from location-inserter/secrets.json
   - **Password**: Use "AUTH_PASS" from location-inserter/secrets.json
   - **URL**: Your location-inserter URL (from deployment step)
   
4. Optional Settings:
   - **pubTopicBase**: Current trip name (will be added to every location)

5. Recommended GPS Settings (for high-accuracy permanent tracking):
   ```
   Mode: Move
   ignoreInaccurateLocations: 50
   locatorDisplacement: 80
   locatorInterval: 30
   positions: 10
   maxHistory: 0
   monitoring: -1
   downgrade: 0
   extended data: True
   ```

For more details on location tracking parameters, see the [OwnTracks Documentation](https://owntracks.org/booklet/features/location/).

### üîí Security Notes
- Store all passwords from setup.py output securely
- All endpoints use HTTPS encryption
- Authentication is required for all access
- Location data is stored only in your Supabase database
